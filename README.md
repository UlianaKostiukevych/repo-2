Test task - Cypress first steps

Hello team! Here is your test task.

Using npm init or npm init -y command initialize a project.
Create a new private repository in our GitHub's organization - GM-internship.
Initialize git repository locally. Add README.md file and briefly describe your project.
Commit package.json and README.md files. Push committed changes to the remote repo (push master branch with 1 commit).
Okay, now let’s back to the local project. Create and switch to a new branch where you’ll work in the scope of this homework.
Install Cypress framework.
Create a test using cypress where you have to fill in the form for the text-box (p.s. https://demoqa.com/ - base url here).
Commit and push created code to the remote repo and create a pull request into master branch. Feel free to review each other.
Good luck and have a nice day!
